Why Redux and Redux-Thunk?
I used Redux because the same state needs to be shared between multiple components and those components doesnâ€™t belong to the same tree hierarch. In redux we have a store, actions and reducers. Here, the data flow is uni-directional and we can have a decoupled design where data management is separated from the UI.

I used Thunk because Thunks are the recommended middleware for basic Redux side effects logic, including complex synchronous logic that needs access to the store, and simple async logic like AJAX requests.
